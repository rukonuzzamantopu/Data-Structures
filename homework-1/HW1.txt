Due: September 18, 2024
Note: Late projects will be assessed a 20% penalty for each day past the due date. Projects will not be accepted more than four days past the due date.

Objective
To comprehend the operations related to date structures within an array, namely insertion, deletion, searching, and traversing 

Problem Description
Write a program for a development company that sells properties. To do this, create a structure, named PropertySale, which records UID or unique identification number, address, ZIP code, size, construction year, and price of a flat that was sold. Create a database of PropertySale structure to store information, called SalesDatabase. Following operations can be performed on this database:

- Insert new flat sale information using a function, named Sales()
- Delete an entry in the database based on UID using a function, named Erase()
- Find an entry in the database using a function, called Search()
- Print an/all element(s) from the databse using a function, called PrintDB()
- GetZIP() and GetPrice() functions will allow access to the ZIP code and sales price of a flat
- Count the total sales in the database using a function called SalesCount()
- Compute the average prices for all the sales using a function, named AveragePrice()

Rubrics
60% Execution. Partial credit will be granted depending on how many of your methods work correctly.
